# About Me Content — 4 Options

Review these and let me know which you prefer. **Option A is implemented in the code** as my top recommendation.

## Option A: Builder-First Narrative ⭐ (Recommended)

> I love building products users love. As an experienced product leader, I've delivered $XXM impact across B2B and B2C contexts and in highly regulated spaces like Payments. In my role at Intuit, I empower small businesses by helping them bill and get paid by their customers.
>
> Outside of work, I like building with and exploring AI. As a new dad, I was surprised there were no digital baby books targeting fathers, so I built one. Trove texts dads a prompt on fatherhood 2x per week; they reply via SMS with a photo and reflection about a recent cherished moment with their kids.
>
> As a writer, I pen essays about product, AI, and peering into the future. Much like an artist builds a portfolio of works, I write to build a portfolio of my thinking.

**Interests:** Product craft, FinTech + payments, AI as a building tool, Writing to think, Building in public, Family + memory

**Why this one:** Leads with building (not compliance). Frames payments as "money + technology" rather than regulatory. The "messy system, simple UX" thread ties everything together and positions you as someone who tames complexity. Broad enough to stretch beyond FinTech.

## Option B: Curiosity-Driven

> I'm a product leader who builds at the edge of what's possible and what's practical. Right now that means FinTech — leading product for QuickBooks Payments at Intuit, where I turn financial complexity into small business simplicity.
>
> I've always been drawn to hard problems in unfamiliar territory. At Deloitte, I built decision-support platforms for government leaders and prototyped computer vision systems — before pivoting to the world of money movement. The through-line isn't the domain; it's the impulse to understand how systems work and make them work better.
>
> Kellogg MBA. Clemson mechanical engineering. Writer (featured in Marginal Revolution). Builder of this site, which started as a dare to Claude.

**Interests:** Systems thinking, FinTech + payments, AI product craft, Writing to think, Building in public, Family + memory

**Why this one:** Emphasizes range and intellectual curiosity. The "through-line" framing makes the career jumps feel intentional. More personality with the "dare to Claude" closer.

## Option C: Concise & Punchy

> Product leader. Builder. Writer. Currently leading QuickBooks Payments at Intuit.
>
> I've spent my career making complex systems feel simple — from FinTech and payments infrastructure to government decision platforms to applied AI. I studied engineering, got an MBA, and write essays that occasionally get picked up by economists (hi, Tyler Cowen).
>
> I believe the best products come from people who write clearly, build relentlessly, and stay curious about domains they don't yet understand.

**Interests:** Product craft, FinTech + payments, AI as a building tool, Writing to think, Building in public, Family + memory

**Why this one:** Maximum density, minimum fluff. Every sentence earns its place. The closing belief statement doubles as a personal brand manifesto. Good if you want the bio to feel confident and editorial.

## Option D: Storyteller

> The first product I ever built was a decision-support system for government leaders managing billion-dollar portfolios. I had no idea what I was doing, but I learned that the best products come from listening harder than everyone else in the room.
>
> That instinct led me to Intuit, where I now lead product for QuickBooks Payments. FinTech is my current arena, but the craft is the constant — I'm happiest when I'm turning something messy into something that feels inevitable.
>
> Along the way: mechanical engineering at Clemson, MBA at Kellogg, essays featured in Marginal Revolution, and a personal site I rebuilt as a video game because I wanted to see if I could.

**Interests:** Product craft, FinTech + payments, AI as a building tool, Writing to think, Building in public, Family + memory

**Why this one:** Opens with a story hook instead of a title. More memorable and human. The "no idea what I was doing" vulnerability builds trust. Strongest personality of the four.
